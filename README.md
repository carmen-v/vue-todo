## Overview

This repository contains a todos app  that gets the todos from  the api and allows you to add new ones. You can see it live on: https://gilded-caramel-7e28c6.netlify.app/.

## Description

The Vue Todos App allows the user to see the todos from the api, and their status (completed or not). Under the list, there is a form that allows the user to create their own todos. Each todo, from the api or written by the user themselves, can be edited, marked as complete or deleted.
This application was developed to demonstrate the use of Javacript/Vuejs, HTML, CSS/SCSS, project architecture, and coding structure.

This repo uses the following technologies/tools:

1. [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) (with the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles))
2. [vite](https://vitejs.dev)
3. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)
